# Iris-Flower-Classification

Artificial Intelligence
leverages computers and machines to
mimic the problem solving, decision
making and predicting capabilities of
the human mind. Machine learning is
a subset of AI which allows a machine
to learn from past data without
learning explicitly.




Iris flower classification is a popular machine learning project under the category of
supervised machine learning. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers ‘Versicolor’,
‘Setosa’, ‘Virginica’ and each class contains 4 features ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal
length’, ‘Petal Width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on
their specific features.
